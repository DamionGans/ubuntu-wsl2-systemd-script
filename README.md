# ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script
Script to enable systemd support on current Ubuntu WSL2 images from the Windows store. 
Tested on 18.04, 20.04 and the versionless (current) version of Ubuntu from the Windows Store.
I am not responsible for broken installations, fights with your roommates and police ringing your door ;-).

__**Note**: Right now I'm trying to get this script working well again. Please grant me some time and I'll do my best. You can make PR requests if you like to and I will try them out.__

Instructions from [the snapcraft forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/running-snaps-on-wsl2-insiders-only-for-now/13033) turned into a script. Thanks to [Daniel](https://forum.snapcraft.io/u/daniel) on the Snapcraft forum! 

## Usage
You need ```git``` to be installed for the commands below to work. Use
```sh
sudo apt install git
```
to do so.
### Run the script and commands
```sh
cd /
git clone https://github.com/DamionGans/ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script.git
cd ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script/
bash ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script.sh
# Enter your password and wait until the script has finished
```
### Then restart the Ubuntu shell and try running systemctl
```sh
systemctl

```
If you don't get an error and see a list of units, the script worked.

Have fun using systemd on your Ubuntu WSL2 image. You may use and change and distribute this script in whatever way you'd like.
